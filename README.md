- 📖 My story:
  In the early years of elementary school, I was afraid of computers and computer science. However, I soon realized that I had a natural talent for it, being the typical math and computer science-minded student. This led me to start "befriending" computers, participating in competitions, and experimenting with computers. I enjoyed changing the defeault settings, testing different configurations and observing the outcomes, eventually losing my fear of making changes. Later on, my parents bought me a book about Python, and that's how it all began. I started enrolling in programming courses, testing different technologies, and now I am where I am today.
